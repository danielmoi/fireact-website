  Foundational knowledge you should know before starting working with Fireactjs.
---
Fireactjs is built with Firebase, Reactjs and Material UI. This guide is written to outline what concepts and technology the documentation assumes that you have knowledge of, and the depth of that knowledge, as well as provide resources to help fill those knowledge gaps.

## Reactjs

Development knowledge of Reactjs is required to be able to customize or extend the framework for your project. If you are not familiar with Reactjs, we recommend you have knowledge in the following areas before getting started with Fireacjs:

- Reactjs components
- Context variables
- React Router DOM v6

## Firebase

Firebase knowledge is nice to have because Fireactjs is built to be hosted on Firebase. If you are not familiar with Firebase, we recommend you to learn about the following areas:

- Firebase tools CLI
- Firebase authentication
- Firestore
- Firebase hosting

## Material UI

Material UI knowledge is nice to have if you want to develop your own components to customize or extend the framework for your project. However, you could use other UI libraries if you like.
